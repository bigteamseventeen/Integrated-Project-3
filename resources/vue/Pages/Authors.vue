							I'm a aspiring full-stack developer studying Bsc Computing at Glasgow Caledonian University. I was asigned as a Programmer and a Tester. I worked on the framework that the application runs off and created the majority of boilerplates.  During development I created the earthquakes page, Made the page for the tutorials to be placed in. I have tested the majority of the site, during development i tested the likelyness and ability of using VueJS for this project and decided to go for it as it is will allow for a single page application and streamline the development process allowing us to develop using TypeScript.

							I am currently studying towards a degree in Computing, before attending university I gained an HND in software development at City of Glasgow College. In the future, I hope to get a job in my field of study. My role in the project was to help with the design of the interface and I created the movie visualisation page, and assisted in other areas too, like the testing aspect and giving general help to the group where I could. This work involved a large amount of self learning and organisation to get the project completed on time to a satisfactory level. I believe I was successful in my role and the project overall was completed to a high standard.

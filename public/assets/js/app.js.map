This allows us to forecast an area from a map or a pre-specified location.\\n\\nTo register for this service head over to the [official website and register](https://www.apixu.com/). After registering and confirming your website you can get visit the documentation and get your api key from [the api page](https://www.apixu.com/api.aspx).\\n\\nInside the [docs](docs) you will get the documentation for the api, like calls for the current weather. \\n\\n## Wrapping the API into useful interfaces\\nAfter we have gained access to the API we can make a call and see what the returned JSON file is \\n```js\\n{\\n\\t\\\"location\\\":{\\n\\t\\t\\\"name\\\":\\\"Petersville\\\",\\n\\t\\t\\\"region\\\":\\\"Alaska\\\",\\n\\t\\t\\\"country\\\":\\\"United States of America\\\",\\n\\t\\t\\\"lat\\\":62.28,\\n\\t\\t\\\"lon\\\":-150.83,\\n\\t\\t\\\"tz_id\\\":\\\"America/Anchorage\\\",\\n\\t\\t\\\"localtime_epoch\\\":1554123674,\\n\\t\\t\\\"localtime\\\":\\\"2019-04-01 5:01\\\"\\n\\t},\\n\\t\\\"current\\\":{\\n\\t\\t\\\"last_updated_epoch\\\":1554123619,\\n\\t\\t\\\"last_updated\\\":\\\"2019-04-01 05:00\\\",\\n\\t\\t\\\"temp_c\\\":-3.3,\\n\\t\\t\\\"temp_f\\\":26.1,\\n\\t\\t\\\"is_day\\\":0,\\n\\t\\t\\\"condition\\\":{\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"text\\\":\\\"Clear\\\",\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"icon\\\":\\\"//cdn.apixu.com/weather/64x64/night/113.png\\\",\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"code\\\":1000\\n\\t\\t},\\n\\t\\t\\\"wind_mph\\\":0,\\n\\t\\t\\\"wind_kph\\\":0,\\n\\t\\t\\\"wind_degree\\\":0,\\n\\t\\t\\\"wind_dir\\\":\\\"N\\\",\\n\\t\\t\\\"pressure_mb\\\":1034,\\n\\t\\t\\\"pressure_in\\\":31,\\n\\t\\t\\\"precip_mm\\\":0,\\n\\t\\t\\\"precip_in\\\":0,\\n\\t\\t\\\"humidity\\\":81,\\n\\t\\t\\\"cloud\\\":0,\\n\\t\\t\\\"feelslike_c\\\":-3.3,\\n\\t\\t\\\"feelslike_f\\\":26.1,\\n\\t\\t\\\"vis_km\\\":16,\\n\\t\\t\\\"vis_miles\\\":9,\\n\\t\\t\\\"uv\\\":0,\\n\\t\\t\\\"gust_mph\\\":5.1,\\n\\t\\t\\\"gust_kph\\\":8.3\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```\\n\\nBy taking this json file we can then turn it into a collection of interfaces, this process can be automated through tools in an code editor like visual studio code, the command is `> Convert json clipboard to TypeScript interfaces`. After doing that you will get a generated list of responses, you will want to go through this and manually check if the data is correct and rename any class names that don't make sense.\\n\\n```js\\nexport interface Astro {\\n\\tmoonrise: string; //\\\"08:10 AM\\\"\\n\\tmoonset: string; // \\\"11:50 PM\\\"\\n\\tsunrise: string; // \\\"06:30 AM\\\"\\n\\tsunset: string; // \\\"08:08 PM\\\"\\n}\\n\\nexport interface Location {\\n\\tname: string;\\n\\tregion: string;\\n\\tcountry: string;\\n\\tlat: number;\\n\\tlon: number;\\n\\ttz_id: string;\\n\\tlocaltime_epoch: number;\\n\\tlocaltime: string;\\n}\\n\\nexport interface WeatherIcon {\\n\\ttext: string;\\n\\ticon: string;\\n\\tcode: number;\\n}\\n\\nexport interface WeatherConditions {\\n\\tlast_updated_epoch: number;\\n\\tlast_updated: string;\\n\\ttemp_c: number;\\n\\ttemp_f: number;\\n\\tis_day: number;\\n\\tcondition: WeatherIcon;\\n\\twind_mph: number;\\n\\twind_kph: number;\\n\\twind_degree: number;\\n\\twind_dir: string;\\n\\tpressure_mb: number;\\n\\tpressure_in: number;\\n\\tprecip_mm: number;\\n\\tprecip_in: number;\\n\\thumidity: number;\\n\\tcloud: number;\\n\\tfeelslike_c: number;\\n\\tfeelslike_f: number;\\n\\tvis_km: number;\\n\\tvis_miles: number;\\n\\tuv: number;\\n\\tgust_mph: number;\\n\\tgust_kph: number;\\n}\\n\\nexport interface WeatherForecast {\\n\\tforecastday: DayForecast[];\\n}\\n\\nexport interface DayForecast {\\n\\tastro: Astro;\\n\\tdate: string;\\n\\tdate_epoch: number;\\n\\tday: WeatherConditions;\\n}\\n\\nexport interface WeatherAPIResponse {\\n\\tlocation: Location;\\n\\tcurrent: WeatherConditions;\\n}\\n\\nexport interface WeatherAPIForecastResponse {\\n\\tcurrent: WeatherConditions;\\n\\tlocation: Location;\\n\\tforecast: WeatherForecast;\\n}\\n\\nexport interface LatLong { lat: number, lng: number }\\n```\\n\\n## Calling the API\\nNow that we can parse information from the API with help of your selected text editor's language server, We will want to call the API functions. To do that we will refer to the docs and create a function that will wrap up the ajax request.\\n\\nThe pattern for the requests for the api is `http://api.apixu.com/v1/{type}.json?key={key}&{...}`. \\n| type | This is the type of request, eg: forecast, current, history etc.                                          |\\n|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| key  | This is the user's api key that we had gotten earlier, this will allow us to authenticate with the server |\\n| ...  | These are any additional arguments defined for the api call                                               |\\n\\n```js\\nconst APIXU_API_KEY = \\\"...\\\";\\nfunction getAPIEndpoint(type) {\\n\\treturn `http://api.apixu.com/v1/${type}.json?key=${APIXU_API_KEY}`;\\n}\\n```\\nUsing this function we can automatically generate the URL of the request for what we need should it be the forecast, history etc by passing it into the paramater (type).\\n\\nWe now have to call the api, using the interfaces we created earlier we can define the callback for the ajax response by setting the response data type to the interface `(weather: WeatherAPIResponse, status:any) => void`\\n\\n| callback | This is the function definition name                                                |\\n|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| weather  | This is the response data from the API, adding the interface allows for suggestions |\\n| status   | This is the request status returned by ajax                                         |\\n\\nThe code for the function looks like this: \\n```js\\nexport function GetCurrentWeather(location: LatLong, \\n\\tcallback: ((weather: WeatherAPIResponse,status) => void), error: ((jqXHR, exception) => void) = null ) \\n{\\n\\tlet qry = `${location.lat.toFixed(4)},${location.lng.toFixed(4)}`;\\n\\tGetCurrentWeather_Query(qry, callback, error);\\n}\\n\\nexport function GetCurrentWeather_Query(qry: string, \\n\\tcallback: ((weather: WeatherAPIResponse,status) => void), error: ((jqXHR, exception) => void) = null ) \\n{\\n\\t$.ajax({\\n\\t\\ttype: \\\"GET\\\",\\n\\t\\turl: `${getAPIEndpoint(\\\"current\\\")}&q=${qry}`,\\n\\t\\tdata: {},\\n\\t\\tsuccess: callback,\\n\\t\\terror: error,\\n\\t\\tdataType: 'json',\\n\\t});\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAnd we can call the function like this \\n```js\\n// this.center = {lat: -21, lng: 20}\\nGetCurrentWeather(this.center, (weather, status) => {\\n\\tconsole.log(\\\"Current Weather: \\\", status, weather);\\n\\t// Do something with the weather information\\n\\t// ...\\n});\\n```\\n\\nUsing that information you can create websites making use of weather statistics.\\n\")])],1)}\nvar staticRenderFns = []\n\nexport { render,

will ask the user for the following information:\\n- The name of the movie they wish to see details of\\n- The year this movie was initially released\\n- Whether or not they want to see the budget AND the revenue generated or just the budget of the movie\\n##### Submission\\n###### Budget and Revenue\\nIf the user ticks the checkbox for viewing the budget and revenue of the movie they have entered, a bar graph will be loaded showing\\n- The budget\\n- The revenue generated\\n- If the movie made a profit, this is shown\\n\\nThe following is displayed in a card below the bar graph:\\n\\n- The movie's poster\\n- The movie's TMDb Movie ID\\n- The title\\n- The average user rating of the movie\\n- A description/overview of the movie\\n- The net profit/loss of the movie\\n\\n###### Budget Only\\n\\nIf the checkbox is left unchecked, then the graph shows the budget only.\\nThe card below the graph loads the same way as if the checkbox had been checked\\n\\n#### Possible Issues\\n- When the user leaves any of the fields blank, the page does not reload\\n- If the user does not enter the correct name and year of release of a movie, the correct details are not guaranteed to load. \\n- For example, entering \\\"Infinity War\\\" and \\\"2019\\\" will return the results for \\\"Avengers: Endgame\\\"\\n\\n#### The API\\n\\nTo get the data for this page, The Movie Database(TMDb) was used.\\n\\nTo get the information, 3 calls are made. The first call uses the details entered by the user to find some initial details about the movie, the 2nd call uses the ID from the initial search to get more details. The 3rd call looks for the films that ranked highest in revenue in the year entered by the user in the form.\\n\\n> This API requires an API key any time a call is made.\\n> This can be found at https://www.themoviedb.org/ by \\n> creating an account and requesting an API key. There is\\n> lots of documentation on this site which is very useful\\n\\n##### Using the user's data to find the ID of the film they are looking for\\n###### Purpose\\nThe purpose of this initial call is to get basic details about the movie, particularly the ID of the movie which is used to get a more detailed look at the movie. Without this first call, the user would need to know the ID of the movie to search for the details required for the graph\\n\\n###### URL\\nThe URL for the first call looks like this:\\nhttps://api.themoviedb.org/3/search/movie?api_key=0ff577cec03e7f3e1f3502ba86722414&language=en-US&query=donnie%20darko&page=1&primary_release_year=2001\\n\\nIn this example, the user has entered \\\"Donnie Darko\\\" as the title and \\\"2001\\\" as the year. These details turn into \\\"query=donnie%20darko\\\" and \\\"primary_release_year=2001\\\". This query is then run using my API key\\n\\n###### How the call was made\\n$.ajax was called using the URL created by the user's input\\n\\nWhen results are successfully returned, the results are stored in a variavble called \\\"searchResults\\\". The results are then used to populate the properties and these properties (Title, ID, average rating, overview and poster path) are displayed to the user.\\n\\nAfter these properties are populated, a function named \\\"findMovieDetails(ID)\\\" is called, passing the movie ID found to find more details. This function will make the next API call\\n\\n###### Data\\nThe following details are returned from this query:\\n| Attribute | Data Type |\\n| ------ | ------ |\\n| vote_count | number |\\n| id | number |\\n| video | boolean |\\n| vote_average | number |\\n| Title | string |\\n| Popularity | number |\\n| Poster_path | string |\\n| original_language | string |\\n| original_title | string |\\n| genre_ids | number |\\n| backdrop_path | string |\\n| adult | boolean |\\n| overview | string |\\n| release_date | date |\\n\\nMost of this data goes unused for this page, the only details needed were: \\n- ID\\n- Title\\n- Vote_average\\n- Overview\\n- Poster_path.\\n\\nThese details are shown to the user in the card below the bar graph and the ID is used in the next call to get more details about the movie\\n\\n##### More details about the movie - Call\\n###### Purpose\\nThe purpose of this call is to get more information about the movie because the initial call does not return all of the data we need. The details about the budget and revenue made by the movie will be returned, which is required for the bar graph\\n\\n###### URL\\nThe URL for this call looks like this:\\nhttps://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/141?language=en-UK&api_key=0ff577cec03e7f3e1f3502ba86722414\\nIn this example, the ID (141) has been taken from the previous call and put into this URL. A query is then run using my API key.\\n\\n###### How the call was made\\nThis call is made in the function \\\"findMovieDetails(ID)\\\". The URL for this call is created using the ID which was passed into the function.\\n\\n$.ajax uses this URL to search for more details. When this is successful, the bar graph method is called, passing the searchResults from this query.\\n\\n###### Data\\nThe following details are returned from this query:\\n| Attribute | Data Type |\\n| ------ | ------ |\\n| adult | boolean |\\n| backdrop_path | string |\\n| belongs_to_collection | Array (Collection ID - number, name - string, poster_path - string, backdrop_path - string) |\\n| budget | number |\\n| genres | Array (Id - number, name - string) |\\n| homepage | string |\\n| id | number |\\n| imdb_id | number |\\n| original_language | string |\\n| original_title | string |\\n| overview | string |\\n| popularity | number |\\n| poster_path | string |\\n| production_companies | Array (id - number, logo_path - string, name - string, origin_country - string) |\\n| release_date | date |\\n| revenue | number |\\n| runtime | number |\\n| status | string |\\n| tagline | string |\\n| title | string |\\n| video | boolean |\\n| vote_average | number |\\n| vote_count | number |\\n\\nAgain, most of this data goes unused and the only details taken from this call are:\\n- budget\\n- revenue\\n\\nThese details are used to calculate the net profit/loss of the movie. These values and the net are displayed in the bar graph, depending on the input of the user.\\n\\n##### Finding the data about the films with the highest revenue in the year entered by the user\\nThis call finds the movies with the highest revenue, takes the IDs of these movies and then gets more details about them. These details are sent to an array and then added to the data table which previously just held the data about the specific film being viewed by the user. More details are displayed below the form, including the movies' posters, descriptions and average rating.\\n\\n#### Drawing Graph\\nGoogle Charts was used to create the graph for this page, the following details are passed to a method named \\\"DrawBarColours()\\\":\\n- Title\\n- Budget\\n- Revenue\\n\\nThe form is checked to see if the user wishes to see just the budget or if they want to view the budget and revenue.\\n\\nThe graph displays the budget and revenue of each film, depending on the 'budget and revenue' checkbox\\n\\nThe options are set so that the budget bar is grey and the revenue bar is green.\\n\\n**END OF TUTORIAL PAGE**\\n**Marc Millar - Team 17**\\n\")])],1)}\nvar staticRenderFns = []\n\nexport { render, staticRenderFns }","export * from

It is based on the\n * <a href=\"http://google-maps-utility-library-v3.googlecode.com/svn/tags/markerclusterer/\"\n * >V3 MarkerClusterer</a> port by Luke Mahe. MarkerClustererPlus was created by Gary Little.\n * <p>\n * v2.0 release: MarkerClustererPlus v2.0 is backward compatible with MarkerClusterer v1.0. It\n *  adds support for the <code>ignoreHidden</code>, <code>title</code>, <code>batchSizeIE</code>,\n *  and <code>calculator</code> properties as well as support for four more events. It also allows\n *  greater control over the styling of the text that appears on the cluster marker. The\n *  documentation has been significantly improved and the overall code has been simplified and\n *  polished. Very large numbers of markers can now be managed without causing Javascript timeout\n *  errors on Internet Explorer. Note that the name of the <code>clusterclick</code> event has been\n *  deprecated. The new name is <code>click</code>, so please change your application code now.\n */\n\n/**\n * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n * You may obtain a copy of the License at\n *\n *     http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n *\n * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n * distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n * limitations under the License.\n */\n\n\n/**\n * @name ClusterIconStyle\n * @class This class represents the object for values in the <code>styles</code> array passed\n *  to the {@link MarkerClusterer} constructor.

Can be called without `new`.\n *\n * ##### presetName\n *\n * MarkdownIt provides named presets as a convenience to quickly\n * enable/disable active syntax rules and options for common use cases.\n *\n * - [\"commonmark\"](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/lib/presets/commonmark.js) -\n *   configures parser to strict [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/) mode.\n * - [default](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/lib/presets/default.js) -\n *   similar to GFM, used when no preset name given. Enables all available rules,\n *   but still without html, typographer & autolinker.\n * - [\"zero\"](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/lib/presets/zero.js) -\n *   all rules disabled. Useful to quickly setup your config via `.enable()`.\n *   For example, when you need only `bold` and `italic` markup and nothing else.\n *\n * ##### options:\n *\n * - __html__ - `false`. Set `true` to enable HTML tags in source. Be careful!\n *   That's not safe! You may need external sanitizer to protect output from XSS.\n *   It's better to extend features via plugins, instead of enabling HTML.\n * - __xhtmlOut__ - `false`. Set `true` to add '/' when closing single tags\n *   (`<br />`). This is needed only for full CommonMark compatibility. In real\n *   world you will need HTML output.\n * - __breaks__ - `false`. Set `true` to convert `\\n` in paragraphs into `<br>`.\n * - __langPrefix__ - `language-`. CSS language class prefix for fenced blocks.\n *   Can be useful for external highlighters.\n * - __linkify__ - `false`. Set `true` to autoconvert URL-like text to links.\n * - __typographer__  - `false`. Set `true` to enable [some language-neutral\n *   replacement](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/lib/rules_core/replacements.js) +\n *   quotes beautification (smartquotes).\n * - __quotes__ - `“”‘’`, String or Array. Double + single quotes replacement\n *   pairs, when typographer enabled and smartquotes on. For example, you can\n *   use `'«»„“'` for Russian, `'„“‚‘'` for German, and\n *   `['«\\xA0', '\\xA0»', '‹\\xA0', '\\xA0›']` for French (including nbsp).\n * - __highlight__ - `null`. Highlighter function for fenced code blocks.\n *   Highlighter `function (str, lang)` should return escaped HTML. It can also\n *   return empty string if the source was not changed and should be escaped\n *   externaly. If result starts with <pre... internal wrapper is skipped.\n *\n * ##### Example\n *\n * ```javascript\n * // commonmark mode\n * var md = require('markdown-it')('commonmark');\n *\n * // default mode\n * var md = require('markdown-it')();\n *\n * // enable everything\n * var md = require('markdown-it')({\n *   html: true,\n *   linkify: true,\n *   typographer: true\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * ##### Syntax highlighting\n *\n * ```js\n * var hljs = require('highlight.js') // https://highlightjs.org/\n *\n * var md = require('markdown-it')({\n *   highlight: function (str, lang) {\n *     if (lang && hljs.getLanguage(lang)) {\n *       try {\n *         return hljs.highlight(lang, str, true).value;\n *       } catch (__) {}\n *     }\n *\n *     return ''; // use external default escaping\n *   }\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * Or with full wrapper override (if you need assign class to `<pre>`):\n *\n * ```javascript\n * var hljs = require('highlight.js') // https://highlightjs.org/\n *\n * // Actual default values\n * var md = require('markdown-it')({\n *   highlight: function (str, lang) {\n *     if (lang && hljs.getLanguage(lang)) {\n *       try {\n *         return '<pre class=\"hljs\"><code>' +\n *                hljs.highlight(lang, str, true).value +\n *                '</code></pre>';\n *       } catch (__) {}\n *     }\n *\n *     return '<pre class=\"hljs\"><code>' + md.utils.escapeHtml(str) + '</code></pre>';\n *   }\n * });\n * ```\n *\n **/\nfunction MarkdownIt(presetName, options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof MarkdownIt)) {\n    return new MarkdownIt(presetName, options);\n  }\n\n  if (!options) {\n    if (!utils.isString(presetName)) {\n      options = presetName || {};\n      presetName = 'default';\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * MarkdownIt#inline -> ParserInline\n   *\n   * Instance of [[ParserInline]].
